Basically, Log time intervals, display total time logged from the last 7 days, and store data in CSV file.

This was before implementing a functioning user system, so it only includes a signin and login page, but they all lead into a singular CSV file. Future plans: Create functioning user system, use database (mangoDB? mySQL?)

I really should learn how README's work...
